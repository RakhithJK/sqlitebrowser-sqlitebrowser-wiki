# Licensing

The DB Browser for SQLite project is licensed under both "Mozilla Public License Version 2" and "GNU General Public License Version 3 or later".

This means that when you are creating something from this project you can choose whichever of the two licenses best suits you, or you can use both of them if you wish. There are places where a Mozilla or GPL license is not permitted, which is why the dual license is useful.

## Footnote

The file sqlitebrowser.desktop.appdata.xml is technically licensed under "Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal" which is normal for AppData files.
