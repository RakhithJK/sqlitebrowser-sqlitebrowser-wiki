If a translation has been partially issued and a Developer thinks that it's wrong the following procedure should be tempted for merging:
1) Contact the former translation releaser to agree on new string
2a) If the translator agrees, merge the two translation and commit
2b) If the former translator doesn't answer in 15days proceed with the new translation and merge the two.
