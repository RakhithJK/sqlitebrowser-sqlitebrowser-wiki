If a translation has been partially submitted and a developer thinks that it's wrong, the following procedure should be followed for resolving the problem:

1. Contact the former translation releaser to agree on new strings.
  * If the former translation releaser agrees, merge the two translations and commit.
  * If the former  translation releaser doesn't answer within 15 days, proceed with the new translation and merge the two.
