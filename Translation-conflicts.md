If a translation has been partially issued and a developer thinks that it's wrong, the following procedure should be tempted for merging:
1. Contact the former translation releaser to agree on new strings.
2.
    - If the translator agrees, merge the two translations and commit.
    - If the former translator doesn't answer in 15 days, proceed with the new translation and merge the two.
