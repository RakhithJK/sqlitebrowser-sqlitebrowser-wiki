## 2. Install Microsoft Visual Studio 2013

To install Microsoft Visual Studio 2013, mount the .iso image.

In Windows 8.1, this is done by simply double clicking on the iso file:

Now run the "vs_community.exe" installer from the mounted drive:

Installation itself is very straightforward.

The only option you need to select is "Microsoft Foundation Classes for C++".

All of the other items can be left off, if you don't have some other need for them:

After it has finished installing, quit out of the installer.  There's no need to launch it just yet.

Eject the mounted ISO too, as it's no longer needed.
