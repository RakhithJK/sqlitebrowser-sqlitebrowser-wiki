## Abstract
This Wiki page aims at listing the more 'hidden' keyboard shortcuts. By this I mean those shortcuts that aren't obviously visible in the menus (e.g. ```Ctrl+N``` for a new database), that aren't simply ```Alt``` accelerators (e.g. ```Alt+E``` for clicking the button with the underlined E), and that aren't typical for all GUI application (e.g. ```Tab``` for changing focus).

## Main window

* ```Alt + 1``` switches to the Database Structure tab.
* ```Alt + 2``` switches to the Browse Data tab.
* ```Alt + 3``` switches to the Edit Pragmas tab.
* ```Alt + 4``` switches to the Execute SQL tab.

#### Database Structure tab

* ```Alt + Delete``` and ```Alt + Backspace``` delete the content of the current cell(s), setting them to NULL.
